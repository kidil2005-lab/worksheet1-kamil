# Worksheet 1 – Assembly Language Programming  
UWE School of Computing and Creative Technologies  
Operating Systems – Worksheet 1  

This repository contains my completed solutions for Worksheet 1.  
The worksheet focuses on introductory x86 assembly programming using NASM,  
basic data handling, control flow, and linking assembly routines with C.

The work for this worksheet is organised into four main tasks:

- **Task 1:** Basic arithmetic operations in assembly  
- **Task 2:** More advanced assembly routines using loops, arrays, input, and validation  
- **Task 3:** A Makefile that builds all programs  
- **Task 4:** Documentation (this README)
